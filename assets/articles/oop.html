                    OOP, or Object-Oriented Programming, is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes as
                    fundamental building blocks for organizing and structuring code. The main idea behind OOP is to
                    model real-world entities and their interactions in a way that is both intuitive and efficient for
                    software development. OOP uses classes as blueprints to define the structure and behavior of objects, and objects are specific instances of these classes with their own unique characteristics.

                <h2>Four Pillars of OOP</h2>
                <ol class="key-features">
                    <br>
                    <p id="text">Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) consists of four core pillars, which are:  </p>
                    <li><strong>Encapsulation</strong>: Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data (attributes) and
                        the methods that operate on that data into a single unit (i.e., an object). This concept helps
                        hide the internal implementation details of an object and exposes only the necessary interfaces
                        for interacting with it. Access to an object's data is typically controlled through getter and
                        setter methods.
                        maintain.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Abstraction</strong>: Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex reality by
                        modeling classes based on essential properties and behaviors while ignoring irrelevant details.
                        It helps manage complexity by focusing on what's important for a particular problem domain.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Inheritance</strong>: Inheritance allows one class (subclass or derived class) to
                        inherit the attributes and methods of another class (base class or parent class). It promotes
                        code reusability and the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes. Subclasses can
                        extend or override the behavior of their parent classes.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Polymorphism</strong>: Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated
                        as objects of a common superclass. It allows for more flexible and generic code by supporting
                        method overriding and dynamic method dispatch. Polymorphism allows you to write code that can
                        work with objects of various types without knowing their specific classes.</li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <h2>Components</h2>
                <br>
                
                <ol class="requirements">
                    <li><strong>Model</strong>: The Model represents the application's data and business logic. It is
                        responsible
                        for managing and manipulating data, as well as responding to requests for information. In many
                        cases, the
                        Model is also responsible for data validation and persistence. It ensures the integrity of the
                        data and
                        communicates any changes to the View and Controller.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>View</strong>: The View is responsible for presenting the data to the user and rendering
                        the user
                        interface. It takes data from the Model and displays it in a format that is understandable to
                        the user.
                        Views can include various elements like buttons, text fields, images, and more. They are
                        typically passive
                        and do not contain application logic.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Controller</strong>: The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the
                        View. It
                        handles user input and translates it into actions that affect the Model or View. Controllers
                        receive user
                        requests, process them, update the Model as necessary, and then update the View to reflect any
                        changes. They
                        contain the application's logic for responding to user interactions.
